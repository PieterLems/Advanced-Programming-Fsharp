//The Caesarâ€™s cypher take a text, represented as a list of characters (note that Typescript does
//not support the type char so you can use a list of string with only one character), and shifts all
//the letters (so only if the character is an alphabetical character) in it up by the number of position
//specified by shift. If the letter goes past z it restarts from a. You can assume that all the text is in lower-case letter.
//For instance:
//shift("c")(5) = h
//shift("y")(5) = d
//The ASCII code for a specific character in a string can be obtained by using the method charCodeAt
//that takes as input the position of the character of the string you want to get the ASCII code of.
//For instance:
//"Caesar".charCodeAt(2) = 101
