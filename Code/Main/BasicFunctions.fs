//that returns a string containing all even numbers between lower and upper. Separate the numbers with a white space.


//let drawLine = (length:number):string
//that returns a string containing length asterisks.

//let toBinary = (n:number):string
//that returns a string containing the binary representation of the input number (it must be positive).
//The binary representation is obtained using the following procedure:
//1. Add to the end of the string the remainder of the division between the current number and 2.
//2. Repeat the previous step until the number is 0. In this case simply donâ€™t add anything.

//let toBase = (n:number) => (base:number):string
//that returns a string containing the representation of the input number in an arbitrary base (the
//number must be positive). The algorithm is the same as above except you must take the remainder of n divided by base


//let filter = <a, b>(p: (x: a) => bool) => (l:List<a>) => List<a>

//let rec filter (p :: x : a bool) (l:List<'a>) : List<'a> 
//let x: List<'b> -> List<'b> = filter((x : int) : x >5)
